# Power_BI_Project---Credit_Card_Analysis_Mitron_Bank
Business Challenge
Mitron Bank, a leading financial institution in Hyderabad, aims to introduce a new range of credit cards to strengthen its market presence. However, before a full-scale rollout, the bank's Strategy Director, Mr. Bashnir Rover, sought data-driven validation. AtliQ Data Services was tasked with conducting a pilot study using a dataset of 4,000 customers across five cities to assess spending patterns and credit card usage trends.

🎯 Project Objective
The objective was to analyze transaction behaviors, identify potential user segments, and generate insights to help Mitron Bank design credit card offerings that align with customer preferences and market trends.

📊 Core Metrics Analyzed
🔹 Spending Efficiency (Income Utilization %): Measures how much of a customer's income is allocated to spending (Avg. Spend / Avg. Income). Higher values indicate potential credit card users.
🔹 Credit Dependency (Credit Card Usage %): The proportion of total expenses paid via credit cards (Total Credit Card Spent / Total Spend).

🔍 Key Findings
📌 Age Influence: Young professionals (25–34) were the biggest spenders, whereas middle-aged individuals (35–45) had the highest reliance on income for expenses.
📌 Gender Trends: Men spent 67% more than women, yet their credit dependence remained moderate at 53%, suggesting different financial priorities.
📌 Marital Status Effect: Married individuals dominated spending with 80% contribution, but singles and married users showed similar spending efficiency (~50%).
📌 Geographical Insights: Mumbai residents spent the most overall, while Delhi and Chennai customers had the highest income utilization rates (41%).
📌 Occupation-Based Patterns: IT employees showed both high spending and credit card adoption, whereas government workers relied more heavily on credit for transactions.
📌 Category Preferences: Bills accounted for the largest share of expenses, while travel & electronics purchases were primarily financed via credit cards.

✅ Personalized Credit Card Offers – Introduce custom credit limits & benefits based on user behavior.
