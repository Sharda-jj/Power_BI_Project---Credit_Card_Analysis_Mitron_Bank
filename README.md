# Power BI Project – Credit Card Analysis for Mitron Bank

## Business Challenge

Mitron Bank, a leading financial institution based in Hyderabad, aimed to launch a new range of credit cards to strengthen its market position. Before executing a full-scale rollout, the Strategy Director, Mr. Bashnir Rover, sought data-backed validation. AtliQ Data Services conducted a pilot study using a dataset of 4,000 customers across five cities to explore spending behavior and credit card usage patterns.

## Project Objective

The primary objective was to analyze transaction behaviors, identify potential customer segments, and provide actionable insights to support the design of targeted credit card offerings aligned with user preferences and regional market trends.

---

## Core Metrics Analyzed

- **Spending Efficiency (Income Utilization %):**  
  Measures the proportion of income spent by customers (Avg. Spend / Avg. Income). A higher percentage indicates greater spending potential and credit card usage likelihood.

- **Credit Dependency (Credit Card Usage %):**  
  Indicates the share of total expenses covered using credit cards (Total Credit Card Spend / Total Spend). This helps in assessing reliance on credit over cash.

---

## Key Findings

- **Age Influence:**  
  Young professionals (ages 25–34) were the highest spenders, while the 35–45 age group relied more on income for expenses.

- **Gender Trends:**  
  Male customers spent 67% more than female customers. However, their credit dependency remained moderate at 53%, indicating different financial behavior patterns.

- **Marital Status:**  
  Married individuals contributed to 80% of overall spending. Despite this, both married and single customers exhibited similar spending efficiency (~50%).

- **Geographical Insights:**  
  Mumbai led in total spending, while Delhi and Chennai recorded the highest income utilization rates (~41%).

- **Occupation-Based Patterns:**  
  IT professionals showed high spending and credit card adoption. In contrast, government employees demonstrated stronger reliance on credit for their transactions.

- **Category Preferences:**  
  Bill payments formed the largest share of expenses. Travel and electronics, however, were primarily funded via credit cards, suggesting category-specific financing preferences.

  Customize credit card limits and benefits based on individual spending and income profiles.
